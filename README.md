# FlaskDogGifs
## The Project
In this project, I implemented a web application. It is part of a tutorial in an article I published in CodeProject. The purpose of this application is to show how to develope micro services in Python using the Flask framework.
## The Functionality of this Application 
This application will run as a web server. It's maintaining a set of dog's pictures in GIF format. If one point a web browser to the URL/PORT of this server, it will randomly pick a picture from the set and display it in the web browser. Refresh the web browser (e.g., by click refresh, press F5/SHIFT+F5 depending on your web browser) the server will randomly pick another picture from the pool and serve it to the web browser to be displayed in place of the previous one.
### Microservices Define
The microservice in this case is the function of the server obtaining picture from the set and serve it to the web browser.
## Project Requirements
### Python 3
My Python version at time of writing:

`python --version` <br>
`Python 3.7.6`
 ### flask
 Ensure that flask is installed by type this command in Python shell:<br><br>
 `import flask`<br>
 If Python returns "module not found", then Flask can be installed with "pip", for example:<br><br>
 `pip install Flask`
